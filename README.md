<h1>C Tests</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

- Labtest_1.c - Number Guessing Game:
This program generates a random number between 1 and 25 and allows the user up to 5 attempts to guess it correctly, providing feedback on whether the guess is too low, too high, or correct. If the user exhausts all attempts without success, the game ends, and their guess history is displayed. It uses loops and conditional statements to handle guesses and provide a fun, interactive experience.

- Labtest_2.c - Word Guessing Game:
This program simulates a word-guessing game where the user guesses one character at a time to uncover the word "coding." Correct guesses reveal the character's position, while incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts, with a maximum of 7 wrong guesses allowed. The game ends either when the word is fully guessed or when the user runs out of attempts, using functions and loops to evaluate and display progress dynamicallyâ€‹
